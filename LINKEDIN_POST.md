🚀 **Excited to share CalorieMeter - an AI-powered calorie tracking revolution!** 🍽️

After building this modern nutrition tracking app, I wanted to share what makes it special:

**🎯 The Problem:**
Traditional calorie tracking is tedious - manually searching databases, guessing portions, and losing motivation. What if you could just take a photo?

**💡 The Solution:**
CalorieMeter uses Google Gemini AI to analyze food photos instantly. Point your camera, snap, and get detailed nutritional breakdowns in seconds.

**✨ Key Features:**
📸 Smart Food Analysis - AI identifies foods and estimates portions automatically
🤖 Natural Language Corrections - "That's actually a large slice, not small" → AI updates instantly
📊 Daily Progress Tracking - Visual charts and 7-day trend analysis
🔒 Privacy-First - All data stored locally on your device
⚡ Works Offline - Full PWA support with service workers
👤 Personalized Goals - BMI calculator with customized calorie targets

**🛠️ Technical Highlights:**
• Built with Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript
• Integrated Google Gemini AI (2.0 Flash, 1.5 Pro) with multi-model fallback
• Styled with Tailwind CSS 4.0 for modern UI
• Comprehensive Jest + React Testing Library test suite
• Mobile-first responsive design
• LocalStorage for privacy-centric data management

**🌟 What I Learned:**
• Integrating AI APIs with intelligent fallback strategies
• Building progressive web apps with offline-first architecture
• Creating intuitive mobile camera interfaces
• Implementing natural language processing for user corrections
• Balancing AI accuracy with user control

**🎁 Best Part?**
It's open source and includes a test API key - anyone can clone and run it immediately. No setup friction!

The future of nutrition tracking is visual, AI-powered, and privacy-focused. This project proves we can build smart tools that respect user data while delivering powerful features.
