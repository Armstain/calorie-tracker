import { ToastContainer } from '@/components/ui/toast';

function MyComponent() {
  const { success, error, info, loading, dismiss, promise } = useToast();

  const handleSuccess = () => {

  };

  const handleError = () => {
    error('Something went wrong', 'Please try again later.');
  };

  const handleLoading = () => {
    const toastId = loading('Processing...', 'Please wait while we analyze your food.');
    // Later: dismiss(toastId);
  };

  const handlePromise = () => {
    const myPromise = fetchData();
    promise(myPromise, {
      loading: 'Loading...',
      success: 'Data loaded successfully!',
      error: 'Failed to load data',
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your component content */}

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & API Setup

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Gemini AI API Key (Optional - default test key provided)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Application URL (for PWA and metadata)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Gemini AI API Setup

The application works out of the box with a provided test API key, but for unlimited usage:

1. **Get Your API Key**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key for Gemini AI
   - Copy the generated key

2. **Configure the Application**
   - Add your API key to `.env.local` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Or enter it in the app settings for user-specific configuration

3. **API Features**
   - **Multi-Model Support**: Automatic fallback between Gemini 2.0 Flash, 1.5 Pro, and 1.5 Flash
   - **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent request management with exponential backoff
   - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery with user-friendly messages
   - **Caching**: Smart response caching to minimize API calls

### Application Configuration

The app includes several configuration options in `lib/config.ts`:

```typescript
// Default application settings
export const APP_CONFIG = {
  DEFAULT_CALORIE_GOAL: 2000,        // Default daily calorie target
  DATA_RETENTION_DAYS: 30,           // How long to keep food entries
  MAX_DAILY_ENTRIES: 50,             // Maximum entries per day
  IMAGE_QUALITY: 0.8,                // Image compression quality
  MAX_IMAGE_SIZE: 1024 * 1024,       // 1MB image size limit
  DEFAULT_TEST_API_KEY: 'provided',   // Built-in test key
}

// Gemini AI model configuration
export const GEMINI_MODELS = {
  'gemini-2.0-flash': {
    url: 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent',
    maxRequestsPerMinute: 15,
    maxRequestsPerDay: 1500,
    priority: 1, // Highest priority
  },
  // Additional models with fallback support
}
```

### PWA Configuration

The application is configured as a Progressive Web App with:

- **Offline Support**: Service worker with intelligent caching
- **Installable**: Can be installed on mobile devices and desktop
- **App-like Experience**: Standalone display mode
- **Optimized Icons**: Multiple icon sizes for different devices

### Storage Configuration

Local storage is configured with:

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Configurable data retention (1-365 days)
- **Quota Management**: Real-time storage usage monitoring
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all stored data
- **Backup/Restore**: JSON export/import functionality

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Working
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure camera permissions are granted in browser
- **HTTPS Required**: Camera API requires HTTPS in production
- **Fallback Option**: Use file upload if camera is unavailable

#### API Errors
- **Rate Limiting**: Wait a moment if you see rate limit errors
- **API Key Issues**: Verify your Gemini API key is correct
- **Network Problems**: Check internet connection and try again

#### Storage Issues
- **Quota Exceeded**: Clear old data or increase retention period
- **Data Corruption**: Use data export/import to recover
- **SSR Errors**: Ensure proper server-side rendering compatibility

#### Performance Issues
- **Large Images**: Images are automatically compressed to 1MB
- **Storage Full**: Regular cleanup removes old entries automatically
- **Slow Analysis**: Try different Gemini models for faster responses

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by opening browser developer tools:

```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true')
// Reload the page to see detailed logging
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for error messages and warnings
2. **Test with Default Key**: Verify the app works with the built-in test API key
3. **Clear Storage**: Reset all data if experiencing persistent issues
4. **Update Browser**: Ensure you're using a modern browser with camera support

for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
  try {
    setRetryAttempt(attempt + 1);
    
    if (attempt > 0) {
      // Wait before retry with exponential backoff
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000));
    }
    
    // API call with comprehensive error handling
    const response = await fetch("/api/gemini-correction", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: correctionPrompt }),
    });

    // Enhanced error classification
    if (response.status === 429) {
      throw new Error('Too many requests. Please wait a moment and try again.');
    } else if (response.status === 503) {
      throw new Error('AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes.');
    } else if (response.status === 401 || response.status === 403) {

    // Success - exit retry loop
    return;
  } catch (error) {
    // Intelligent retry decision based on error type
    if (error.message.includes('Too many requests') && attempt < maxRetries) {
      continue; // Retry for rate limits
    }
    break; // Exit for other errors
  }
}

// Enhanced Results Display with Correction Support
interface ResultsProps {
  analysisResult: FoodAnalysisResult;
  onAddToDaily: () => void;

- **Female Formula**: 447.593 + (9.247 √ó weight_kg) + (3.098 √ó height_cm) - (4.330 √ó age)
- **Non-Binary/Other**: Average of male and female calculations for inclusive support
- **Unit Conversion**: Automatic conversion from imperial to metric for calculation accuracy

#### TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
- **Formula**: BMR √ó Activity Level Multiplier
- **Activity Levels with Scientific Multipliers**:
  - **Sedentary (1.2x)**: Little or no exercise, desk job
  - **Light (1.375x)**: Light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week
  - **Moderate (1.55x)**: Moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week
  - **Active (1.725x)**: Hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week
  - **Very Active (1.9x)**: Very hard exercise/sports & physical job

#### Goal-Based Calorie Adjustments
- **Weight Loss**: -500 calories/day (sustainable 1 lb/week loss)
- **Weight Gain**: +500 calories/day (healthy 1 lb/week gain)
- **Maintenance**: No adjustment (TDEE = daily goal)
- **Muscle Building**: +300 calories/day (optimized for lean mass gain)

#### BMI (Body Mass Index) Analysis
- **Formula**: weight_kg / (height_m)¬≤
- **Categories with Color Coding**:
  - **Underweight (<18.5)**: Blue indicator with health recommendations
  - **Normal (18.5-24.9)**: Green indicator showing healthy range
