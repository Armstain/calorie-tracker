# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a personal profile system with an onboarding flow for new users of the CalorieMeter application. The system will collect essential user information during their first visit to personalize their experience and improve calorie tracking accuracy. Existing users will bypass both the onboarding flow and the splash screen for a seamless experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to complete an onboarding process when I first open the app, so that I can provide my personal information for accurate calorie tracking and goal setting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL display an onboarding flow instead of the main application interface
2. WHEN the onboarding flow starts THEN the system SHALL present a welcome screen explaining the purpose of the profile setup
3. WHEN a user progresses through onboarding THEN the system SHALL collect basic demographic information (age, gender, height, weight)
4. WHEN a user progresses through onboarding THEN the system SHALL collect activity level and fitness goals
5. WHEN a user completes the onboarding flow THEN the system SHALL save their profile data to local storage
6. WHEN a user completes onboarding THEN the system SHALL mark them as an existing user to skip future onboarding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to skip the onboarding flow and splash screen, so that I can quickly access the main application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an existing user opens the app THEN the system SHALL bypass the onboarding flow completely
2. WHEN an existing user opens the app THEN the system SHALL bypass the splash screen
3. WHEN an existing user opens the app THEN the system SHALL load directly to the main application interface
4. IF a user has completed onboarding previously THEN the system SHALL remember their status across browser sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile information to be used for personalized calorie recommendations, so that I receive more accurate health and fitness guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system calculates daily calorie goals THEN it SHALL use the user's profile data (age, gender, height, weight, activity level)
2. WHEN the system provides health recommendations THEN it SHALL consider the user's fitness goals
3. WHEN the system displays BMI calculations THEN it SHALL use the stored height and weight data
4. IF a user's profile is incomplete THEN the system SHALL use default values with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to update my profile information after onboarding, so that I can keep my data current as my circumstances change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses profile settings THEN the system SHALL display all previously entered profile information
2. WHEN a user modifies profile information THEN the system SHALL validate the new data before saving
3. WHEN a user saves profile changes THEN the system SHALL update the stored profile data immediately
4. WHEN profile data is updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate any dependent values (BMI, calorie goals)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the onboarding process to be intuitive and mobile-friendly, so that I can easily complete it on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the onboarding flow is displayed THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and mobile-optimized
2. WHEN a user navigates through onboarding steps THEN the system SHALL provide clear progress indicators
3. WHEN a user encounters form validation errors THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
4. WHEN a user wants to go back to previous steps THEN the system SHALL allow backward navigation
5. IF a user closes the app during onboarding THEN the system SHALL save their progress and resume where they left off

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile data to remain private and secure, so that my personal information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data is stored THEN the system SHALL use only local browser storage (no external transmission)
2. WHEN the app is uninstalled or data is cleared THEN the system SHALL treat the user as new again
3. WHEN profile data is accessed THEN the system SHALL only use it for app functionality within the user's device
4. IF the user wants to clear their profile THEN the system SHALL provide an option to reset and start onboarding again
