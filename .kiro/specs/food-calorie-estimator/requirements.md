# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to capture photos of food using their device camera and receive AI-powered calorie estimates through Gemini AI integration. The application will provide a simple, intuitive interface for food photography and display detailed nutritional analysis results, all while staying within free tier limitations of Google's AI services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to capture photos of my food using my device camera, so that I can get calorie estimates without needing to manually input food details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a prominent camera capture button

3. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL open the device's camera interface
4. WHEN the user takes a photo THEN the system SHALL capture the image and display a preview
5. WHEN the photo is captured THEN the system SHALL provide options to retake or proceed with analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to analyze my food photos using Gemini AI, so that I can get accurate calorie estimates and food identification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user confirms a captured photo THEN the system SHALL send the image to Gemini AI for analysis
2. WHEN sending to Gemini AI THEN the system SHALL use the free tier API to stay within cost limits
3. WHEN Gemini processes the image THEN the system SHALL receive food identification and calorie estimates
4. IF the image cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL parse and structure the response data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed results of the food analysis, so that I can understand what foods were identified and their calorie content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are received THEN the system SHALL display identified food names clearly
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show calorie estimates per food item
3. WHEN showing calorie data THEN the system SHALL include total calorie count for the entire meal
4. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the original photo alongside the analysis
5. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL provide an option to analyze another photo

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work efficiently on mobile devices, so that I can easily use it while eating or cooking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the app on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for touch
2. WHEN using the camera on mobile THEN the system SHALL utilize the device's native camera capabilities
3. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL load quickly and work offline for the UI components
4. WHEN taking photos THEN the system SHALL handle different image orientations correctly
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL format content appropriately for mobile screens

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with Gemini AI using free tier options, so that the app remains cost-effective while providing accurate analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Gemini integration THEN the system SHALL use Google's free tier API limits
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling for rate limits
3. WHEN authenticating with Google services THEN the system SHALL use secure API key management
4. IF using Firebase Functions THEN the system SHALL stay within free tier compute limits
5. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL implement client-side processing to minimize server costs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my daily calorie intake, so that I can monitor my eating habits and maintain awareness of my consumption patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a food analysis is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically add the calories to the current day's total
2. WHEN viewing daily tracking THEN the system SHALL display total calories consumed for the current day
3. WHEN accessing the app THEN the system SHALL show a running total of calories for today
4. WHEN a new day begins THEN the system SHALL reset the daily counter and archive previous day's data
5. WHEN viewing daily history THEN the system SHALL allow users to see calorie intake for previous days

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set and track progress toward daily calorie goals, so that I can maintain healthy eating habits and achieve my nutritional objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN first using the app THEN the system SHALL allow users to set a daily calorie goal
2. WHEN calories are added throughout the day THEN the system SHALL display progress toward the daily goal
3. WHEN approaching the daily goal THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators of progress (progress bar, percentage)
4. WHEN the daily goal is reached THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback to the user
5. WHEN exceeding the daily goal THEN the system SHALL display the overage amount clearly
6. WHEN viewing goal settings THEN the system SHALL allow users to modify their daily calorie target

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my calorie intake history and trends, so that I can understand my eating patterns over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing history view THEN the system SHALL display calorie intake for the past 7 days
2. WHEN viewing weekly data THEN the system SHALL show average daily intake for the week
3. WHEN displaying history THEN the system SHALL use simple charts or graphs to visualize trends
4. WHEN reviewing past entries THEN the system SHALL show individual meals and their calorie contributions
5. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL highlight days when goals were met or exceeded

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to persist locally, so that I can access my tracking history without requiring constant internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calorie data is recorded THEN the system SHALL store it in local browser storage
2. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display stored calorie history
3. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL continue to function for viewing historical data
4. WHEN storage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL manage data retention appropriately
5. WHEN clearing browser data THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about data loss

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria
